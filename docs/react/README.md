# React

## Introduction

I always want to learn react.js, I have used Vue.js to develop the project for two years. However, React.js is not easier to understand than Vue.js. I bought a few reference book, and also found some online videos and articles to learn. Unfortunately, I always cannot understand it very clear and used it to develop a project. I really understand the junior developer wants to learn React.js, and confuse with it. That is the reason write down this blog. It will not only helps me settle my React knowledge, but also give the kind of people same as me hands to clear understand what the React.js is.
